NODE ARCHITECTURE



Node.js architecture is a single-threaded event loop architecture that uses JavaScript to run server-side applications. It's designed to process requests from multiple clients simultaneously and handle heavy I/O tasks. The architecture has several key components, including:
Event queue
A waiting list for requests that follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order
Thread pool
A repository of threads that can perform operations to process requests
Event loop
An indefinite loop that receives requests from the event queue, processes them, and sends responses back to clients
External resources
Can include databases, file systems, and other resources for data storage, computation, and blocking client requests
